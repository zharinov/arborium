# Development Guide

This document covers the architecture and development workflow for arborium.

## Architecture Overview

### Crate Structure

Arborium consists of several types of crates:

**Pre-group crates** (publish first):
- `tree-sitter-patched-arborium` - Patched tree-sitter core
- `tree-sitter-highlight-patched-arborium` - Patched highlighting library
- `crates/arborium-sysroot` - WASM sysroot for grammar crates
- `crates/arborium-test-harness` - Test utilities for grammars

**Grammar crates** (in `langs/group-*/*/crate/`):
- Each grammar is an independent crate (e.g., `arborium-rust`, `arborium-svelte`)
- Only depends on pre-group crates, **not on other grammar crates**
- Organized into groups: acorn, birch, cedar, fern, hazel, maple, moss, pine, sage, willow
- All grammar crates (and their corresponding WASM plugin crates in `npm/`) share a single
  workspace defined in `langs/Cargo.toml`, which `cargo xtask gen` regenerates. This keeps
  compilation artifacts under one `target/` when running `cargo --manifest-path langs/Cargo.toml build --workspace`.

**Post-group crates** (publish last):
- `crates/arborium` - Umbrella crate with feature flags for all grammars

### Language Injections

Languages like HTML, Svelte, and Vue support **language injections** - embedding one
language inside another (e.g., JavaScript in `<script>` tags, CSS in `<style>` tags).

#### How Injections Work

Injection queries (in `def/queries/injections.scm`) reference other languages **by name**:

```scheme
; From svelte's injections.scm
((script_element
  (raw_text) @injection.content)
  (#set! injection.language "javascript"))

((style_element
  (raw_text) @injection.content)
 (#set! injection.language "css"))
```

The grammar itself has **no Cargo dependency** on the injected languages. The dependency
is purely nominal - it says "this region should be highlighted as javascript".

#### Injection Resolution by Platform

**Native Rust crate (`arborium`):**
- All grammars compiled into one binary via feature flags
- `Highlighter` struct has a HashMap of language configs
- Injection callback looks up languages from this HashMap
- Feature dependencies ensure required languages are included:
  ```toml
  lang-svelte = ["dep:arborium-svelte", "lang-javascript", "lang-css", "lang-typescript"]
  ```

**WASM demo:**
- Uses `arborium` compiled to WASM with `all-languages` feature
- Same as native - all grammars in one binary, injections resolved internally

**Individual npm packages (`@arborium/svelte`, etc.):**
- Each is a standalone WASM module with just that grammar
- **Cannot** resolve injections on their own
- Host application must:
  1. Load multiple grammar WASM modules
  2. Parse injection queries
  3. Route injection requests to appropriate grammar modules

### Publishing Order

Because grammar crates don't depend on each other (only on pre-group crates), they can
be published in any order after pre-group and before post-group:

```bash
# 1. Publish pre-group crates first
cargo xtask publish crates --group pre

# 2. Publish language groups (any order)
cargo xtask publish crates --group acorn
cargo xtask publish crates --group birch
# ... etc

# 3. Publish post-group crates last
cargo xtask publish crates --group post

# 4. Publish npm packages (no ordering constraints)
cargo xtask publish npm
```

## Development Workflow

### Adding a New Grammar

1. Create the grammar definition in `langs/group-<name>/<lang>/def/`
2. Run `cargo xtask gen` to generate crate files
3. Build or test the generated crates through the shared workspace, e.g.:
   `cargo --manifest-path langs/Cargo.toml check -p arborium-<lang>`
4. Run `cargo xtask build <lang>` to build the WASM plugin
5. Test with `cargo xtask serve`

### Modifying xtask

After modifying xtask code, the next `cargo xtask` invocation will recompile automatically.

Commands show "next steps" hints after completion to guide the workflow.
