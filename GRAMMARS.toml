trivia = "C++ was originally called 'C with Classes' when Bjarne Stroustrup began developing it at Bell Labs in 1979. The '++' in the name is the C increment operator, suggesting C++ is an enhanced version of C. Stroustrup famously said 'There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses.' C++ is used in everything from game engines to operating systems to high-frequency trading."

description = "A purely functional language with dependent types for writing verified, type-safe programs"
wikipedia = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idris_(programming_language)"
trivia = "Idris is designed for theorem proving and writing provably correct software using dependent types, where types can depend on values. This allows programmers to encode complex properties about their programs directly in the type system. For example, you can define a vector type that includes its length, making it impossible to access out-of-bounds elements at compile time."

wikipedia = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)"
trivia = "Java was originally called Oak, named after an oak tree outside James Gosling's office at Sun Microsystems. The name was later changed to Java, inspired by Java coffee.
