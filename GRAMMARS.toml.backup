# Vendored tree-sitter grammars
#
# This file tracks the upstream sources and commit hashes for all vendored grammars.
# Run `cargo xtask check-updates` to see if any grammars have newer versions available.
# Run `cargo xtask vendor <grammar>` to update a specific grammar to the latest version.
#
# TODO: Add language metadata fields to each grammar entry:
#   - inventor: Who created the language (e.g., "Guido van Rossum")
#   - year: Year the language was first released (e.g., 1991)
#   - description: Brief description of what the language is used for
#   - wikipedia: Link to Wikipedia article
#   - trivia: A short paragraph with interesting facts about the language
#   - icon: Path to language icon/logo (SVG preferred)
# This metadata will be used in the demo to show language information.
#
# TODO: Demo UI enhancement - show the language icon as a very low-contrast
# watermark in the background of the code editor area.
