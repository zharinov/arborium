trivia = "Scheme was created at MIT AI Lab and influenced the design of many languages including JavaScript (which borrowed first-class functions and closures). The language was intentionally small - the original spec fit on 50 pages. Scheme's name comes from 'Schemer', after the AI language Planner, but was shortened due to filename length limits."
