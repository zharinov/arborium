    description "Low-level programming language that maps mnemonic instructions directly to machine code; the earliest published example was Booth's 1947 ARC2 'Contracted Notation' assembler (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Booth\">Kathleen Booth</a>)."

    trivia "Booth detailed one of the first assemblers in her 1947 ARC report, and backward compatibility means the <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/Intel8086ProgrammersReferenceManual\">Intel 8086 Programmer's Reference Manual</a> is still relevant today."
