    trivia "Chris Lattner started Swift as a personal project in 2010 while working at Apple, spending 18 months on it before getting approval to make it official. He also created LLVM and Clang. Swift was designed to be a safer language than Objective-C, eliminating entire categories of bugs through features like optionals and automatic memory management."
